## Overview

### A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Welcome to the Dice Roll app! This Android application simulates rolling five dice, with the results displayed as images. The app utilizes the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, Kotlin, and modern Android components to provide a responsive and interactive experience.

## Features
1. Roll five dice simultaneously with a single button click.
2. Dice images dynamically update based on the rolled values.
3. Asynchronous dice rolling animation for a realistic effect.
4. Utilizes ViewModel to handle data and logic, ensuring a clean separation between UI and business logic.
